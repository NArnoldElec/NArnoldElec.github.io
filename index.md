I am an Electrical Engineering major and my expected graduation date is Spring 28.

## Favorite Labs CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1 Part 1 - MadLib
This was a favorite lab of mine because not only was it the introductory lab, it helped me learn about coding in C++ on a Linux OS which is something I was not familiar with at all. Also utilizing git and GitHub are very new to me so I was very excited to start this venture in coding.

Lab 3 Part 2 - DateDiffCalculator
This lab was tedious but I think thats why I enjoyed it. The importance of accurate coding and using PromptFor which is a useful function when writing any code that requires user input. Also, using input and output in conjunction with functions is very useful to know.

Lab 6 Part 2 - BlackJack
Black Jack was an excellent lab using an insane amount of "if" and "bool". Learning operators associated with these also set up the ground work for future labs to come. This lab seemed rather simple only after you learned the pattern in the code. It was also fun to learn command line arguments which were seen in every lab from here on out.
